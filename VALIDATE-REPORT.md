# PyAMA-Qt Refactoring Validation Report

This report details the method-level comparison between the original PyAMA-Qt (`pyama-v011`) and the refactored version (`pyama-vibe`), based on the plan in `VALIDATE.md`. The analysis is based on a static review of the code.

The refactoring from `pyama-v011` to `pyama-vibe` represents a significant architectural shift from a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to a more consolidated component-based architecture where Qt widgets encapsulate their own logic and state. This report validates that functionality has been preserved during this transition.

## 1. Processing Module Comparison

The processing module's logic, previously split across `views`, `models`, and `controllers`, is now consolidated within the `pyama_qt.processing` package.

### 1.1. `views/processing/workflow_panel.py` vs. `processing/workflow.py`

The `ProcessingConfigPanel` class is the main component in both versions.

**Original File:** `pyama-v011/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/views/processing/workflow_panel.py`
**Refactored File:** `pyama-vibe/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/processing/workflow.py`

| Method/Functionality | Original (`pyama-v011`) | Refactored (`pyama-vibe`) | Behavior Preserved | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Channel Options** | `set_channel_options()` | `set_channel_options()` | Yes | Both methods populate the phase and fluorescence channel selectors from metadata. The refactored version is directly part of the `ProcessingConfigPanel` widget. |
| **Microscopy Path** | `display_microscopy_path()` | `display_microscopy_path()` | Yes | Both methods update the UI to display the path of the selected microscopy file. |
| **Parameter Defaults** | `set_parameter_defaults()` | `set_parameter_defaults()` | Yes | Both methods set default values in the `ParameterPanel`. |
| **Signal Definitions** | `file_selected`, `output_dir_selected`, `channels_changed`, `parameters_changed`, `process_requested` | `file_selected`, `output_dir_selected`, `channels_changed`, `parameters_changed`, `process_requested` | Yes | The signals are identical, ensuring the component's public interface for interaction remains consistent. |

### 1.2. `views/processing/merge_panel.py` vs. `processing/merge.py`

The `ProcessingMergePanel` is the core component for handling sample merging.

**Original File:** `pyama-v011/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/views/processing/merge_panel.py`
**Refactored File:** `pyama-vibe/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/processing/merge.py`

| **Signal Definitions** | `load_samples_requested`, `save_samples_requested`, `merge_requested` | `load_samples_requested`, `save_samples_requested`, `merge_requested` | Yes | The public signals for triggering actions are preserved. |

### 1.3. `controllers/processing.py` vs. `processing/main_tab.py`

The controller logic has been integrated into the `ProcessingTab` widget, which now orchestrates the `ProcessingConfigPanel` and `ProcessingMergePanel`.

**Original File:** `pyama-v011/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/controllers/processing.py`
**Refactored File:** `pyama-vibe/pyama-qt/src/pyama_qt/processing/main_tab.py`

## 4. Further Validation (Manual Testing Required)

The following validation steps from `VALIDATE.md` require dynamic analysis and manual testing, which are beyond the scope of this static code review. It is recommended to perform these tests to ensure the refactoring was fully successful.

*   **Signal and Event Handler Comparison:** While the public signals appear preserved, a full comparison of all internal connections and event handlers requires running the application and testing each UI interaction.
*   **Threading and Background Processing Comparison:** The worker implementations (`_AnalysisWorker`, `_WorkflowRunner`, etc.) seem to have been preserved, but verifying their behavior under load, including cancellation and progress reporting, requires manual testing.
*   **Integration Testing:** End-to-end workflows for processing, analysis, and visualization must be tested manually to ensure all components interact correctly.
*   **UI Workflow Validation:** Manual test scenarios should be executed to confirm that all UI elements behave identically and that the user experience is unchanged.
*   **Code Coverage Validation:** Running the test suite and comparing code coverage between the two versions would provide a quantitative measure of preserved functionality.
