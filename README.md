- **pyama-acdc**: Cell-ACDC integration plugin

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Automated Processing**: End-to-end pipeline from ND2/CZI files to CSV traces
- **Multi-channel Support**: Process phase contrast and multiple fluorescence channels
- **Deep Learning**: Spotiflow-based particle detection for fluorescence spot counting
- **Quality Control**: Interactive trace inspection and filtering
- **Model Fitting**: Built-in models for protein maturation and decay analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large datasets with configurable parallelism
- **REST API & MCP**: FastAPI server with Model Context Protocol integration for programmatic access
- **Modern Web UI**: Preact + Tauri desktop application with task management
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom features and models

## 🖥️ CLI Commands

```bash
# Run processing workflow (interactive or config-based)
uv run pyama-core workflow
uv run pyama-core workflow --config config.yaml --nd2-path data.nd2

# Merge CSV outputs from multiple samples
uv run pyama-core merge

# Plot cell trajectories
uv run pyama-core trajectory traces.csv

# Plot numpy array files
uv run pyama-core plot data.npy

# Start the API server
uv run pyama-core serve --port 8000 --reload

# Connect Claude Code as an MCP client (requires server running)
export PYAMA_MCP_URL="http://localhost:8000"  # adjust host/port as needed
claude mcp add pyama --transport http "$PYAMA_MCP_URL/mcp"
```

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip
- Qt6 for GUI applications (pyama-qt)
- Node.js and Bun/npm for web frontend (pyama-preact)
