"""IoU-based cell tracking using Hungarian assignment.

This module extracts connected components per frame, builds a cost matrix
from bounding-box IoU between consecutive frames, solves an optimal one-to-one
assignment, and writes consistent cell IDs into a labeled ``(T, H, W)`` stack.

The public entrypoint is ``track_cell`` which operates in-place on the
preallocated output array.
