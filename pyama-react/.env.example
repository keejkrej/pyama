# Claude Agent SDK Authentication
# ================================
# The SDK uses Claude Code as its runtime and will automatically use
# your existing Claude Code authentication (OAuth from Claude subscription).
#
# If you've already run `claude` and logged in, no configuration is needed!
#
# Alternative: Set an API key if you prefer API-based billing:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
